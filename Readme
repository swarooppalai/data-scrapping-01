# Flipkart Data Scraping

## Overview:

This Python script leverages BeautifulSoup, requests, pandas, and datetime to scrape product details such as name, price, and ratings from a Flipkart product page. The data is stored in a CSV file for analysis and tracking.

## Features:

- **Data Retrieval:** Utilises BeautifulSoup and requests to extract product details (name, price, ratings) from a Flipkart product page.
- **CSV Export:** Saves the extracted data to a CSV file for easy analysis.
- **Automated Price Checking:** Includes a function to automatically check and update the price at regular intervals.
- **Time stamping:** Adds a timestamp to each data entry to track when the information was fetched.

## Usage:

1. Install required libraries: `beautifulsoup4`, `requests`, `pandas`.

   ```bash
   pip install beautifulsoup4 requests pandas

2. Run the script

	bash
	python flipkart_data_scraping.py
3. The data will be save in ‘flipkart_data_scrapping.csv’ for further analysis.

##File structure:

1. ‘flipkart_data_scrapping.py’ : The main Python script 
2. ‘flipkart_data_scrapping.csv’ : CSV file where the scraped data is stored.
